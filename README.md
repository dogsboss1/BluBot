# BluBot
An app that sends serial data via bluetooth/wireless.

Correction, sorry an app that trys to send serial data - it ain't working. 
I have a Bluno (a type of arduino with in built blutooth) attached to a little maze robot I made and I was trying to send signals to it. If it worked then I would have a small robot that could be semi-autonamous, autonamous or user controlled which I find very cool.

I've put this app on the bottom of my list however bluetooth comunication is something that I am very intrested in. So it was a shame to stop working on it, I am going to try adn get some help but for now it's using dodgy wirless transmitter and recievers.

When I get this app working I am going to put it into Affix (my remote controller app for controlling vehicles).
